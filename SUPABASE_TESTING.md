# Supabase Integration for Tatvan Kepenk

This document provides instructions for testing and verifying the Supabase integration for the Tatvan Kepenk website.

## Fixed Issues

1. **Missing Closing Bracket**: Fixed the `getGalleryItems()` method in `SupabaseService` that was missing a closing bracket.
2. **Method Name Mismatch**: Resolved a mismatch between `saveAboutSection()` and `saveAboutContent()` methods.
3. **Field Name Corrections**: Fixed field name inconsistencies:
   - Changed `section_id` to `section_number` in the `about_sections` table
   - Changed `image_path` to `image_url` in the gallery display
   - Fixed `is_read` to `read` in the `contact_forms` table
4. **Missing Field**: Added the `phone` field to `contact_forms` table

## Testing the Implementation

1. **Run the SQL Update Script**:
   - Log into your Supabase project
   - Go to the SQL Editor
   - Copy and paste the contents of `supabase_update.sql`
   - Run the script to update your tables

2. **Test Displaying Content**:
   - Launch the app
   - Navigate to the Supabase Content View page
   - All content should load correctly without errors
   - Gallery images should display properly

3. **Test Admin Panel**:
   - Log in to the admin panel
   - Try editing content in each section
   - Save changes and verify they persist in Supabase

4. **Test Gallery Uploads**:
   - In the admin panel, try uploading a new gallery image
   - Provide title, description, and location
   - Save and verify the image appears in the gallery view

5. **Test Contact Form**:
   - Fill out and submit the contact form
   - Check in the admin panel that the submission was received
   - Mark as read and verify the status changes

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Console for Errors**: Flutter debug console will show any errors occurring during API calls.
2. **Verify Supabase Credentials**: Make sure your URL and anon key are correct in `supabase_config.dart`.
3. **Check Network Requests**: Use the Network tab in your browser developer tools to inspect API calls.
4. **Table Structure**: Verify that the table structure matches what's expected by the code.
5. **RLS Policies**: Ensure Row-Level Security policies are correctly set up as detailed in the SQL file.

## Future Improvements

- Implement proper error handling for network failures
- Add offline caching and sync capability
- Add user authentication for admin access
- Implement optimistic UI updates for better user experience
