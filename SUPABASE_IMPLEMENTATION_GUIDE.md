# Supabase Implementation Guide for Tatvan Kepenk

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Supabase integration for the Tatvan Kepenk Flutter application.

## Architecture

The Supabase implementation follows a service-oriented architecture:

1. **SupabaseConfig**: Contains connection information (URL and anonymous key)
2. **SupabaseService**: Handles direct communication with Supabase APIs 
3. **SupabaseContentService**: Manages caching and synchronization between local and remote data

## Data Structure

### Database Tables

The following tables are implemented in Supabase:

1. **home_content**: Stores homepage content
   - id: UUID (primary key)
   - title: Text
   - description: Text
   - created_at: Timestamp
   - updated_at: Timestamp

2. **kepenk_content**: Stores kepenk systems content
   - id: UUID (primary key)
   - title: Text
   - description: Text
   - created_at: Timestamp
   - updated_at: Timestamp

3. **kapilar_content**: Stores industrial doors content
   - id: UUID (primary key)
   - title: Text
   - description: Text
   - created_at: Timestamp
   - updated_at: Timestamp

4. **gallery_items**: Stores gallery items
   - id: UUID (primary key)
   - title: Text
   - description: Text
   - image_url: Text
   - location: Text
   - date: Timestamp
   - created_at: Timestamp
   - updated_at: Timestamp

5. **about_sections**: Stores about us section content
   - id: UUID (primary key)
   - section_number: Integer
   - title: Text
   - description: Text
   - created_at: Timestamp
   - updated_at: Timestamp

6. **contact_info**: Stores contact information
   - id: UUID (primary key)
   - address: Text
   - phone: Text
   - email: Text
   - work_hours: Text
   - created_at: Timestamp
   - updated_at: Timestamp

7. **contact_forms**: Stores contact form submissions
   - id: UUID (primary key)
   - name: Text
   - email: Text
   - phone: Text
   - message: Text
   - date: Timestamp
   - read: Boolean
   - created_at: Timestamp

### Storage

The application uses a Supabase storage bucket named `tatvan-images` with the following structure:

- `gallery/`: Contains gallery images with UUID filenames

## Key Components

### SupabaseService

This service is responsible for:

- Initializing the Supabase client
- Providing CRUD operations for all content types
- Managing image uploads and deletions
- Handling contact form submissions

### SupabaseContentService

This service is responsible for:

- Caching data in SharedPreferences
- Synchronizing local and remote data
- Providing getter and setter methods for content

## Authentication Flow

1. User credentials are validated against Supabase Authentication
2. Upon successful login, a session is established
3. Row Level Security (RLS) policies ensure only authenticated users can modify data

## Error Handling

The implementation includes several error handling mechanisms:

1. Try-catch blocks around all Supabase API calls
2. Fallback to cached data when network operations fail
3. User-friendly error messages in the UI
4. Detailed error logging for debugging

## Security Considerations

1. **Row Level Security (RLS)**: All tables have RLS policies to control access
2. **Anonymous Key**: Used for public read operations only
3. **Authentication**: Required for all write operations

## Performance Optimization

1. **Caching**: All content is cached locally to reduce API calls
2. **Lazy Loading**: Images are loaded on demand
3. **Batch Operations**: Content synchronization happens in batches

## Maintenance Guidelines

1. **Schema Changes**: If new fields are added to tables, update both the service methods and UI accordingly
2. **API Changes**: If Supabase SDK is updated, check for breaking changes
3. **Error Monitoring**: Regularly check error logs for recurring issues

## Future Enhancements

1. Implement offline support with local-first data approach
2. Add real-time updates using Supabase Realtime
3. Implement user management for different admin roles
4. Add analytics for tracking content engagement

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **Connection Issues**: Check internet connectivity and Supabase URL/key
2. **Authentication Failures**: Verify credentials and check for expired sessions
3. **Data Not Updating**: Check RLS policies and ensure proper synchronization
4. **Image Upload Failures**: Verify storage bucket permissions
