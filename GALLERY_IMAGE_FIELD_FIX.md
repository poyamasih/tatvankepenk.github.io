# Gallery Image Field Fix

## Issue

We encountered an inconsistency with the image field names in the gallery_items table. The database was using `image_path` but the code was looking for `image_url`. This caused the gallery images not to display on the website.

## Solution

We implemented the following fixes:

1. Updated the code to handle both field names:
   - Modified `_buildProjectCard` in `supabase_project_gallery.dart` to check both `image_url` and `image_path`
   - Updated `getGalleryItems` in `supabase_service.dart` to copy values from `image_path` to `image_url` for consistency

2. Created a database script (`supabase_image_fields_fix.sql`) that:
   - Adds the `image_url` column if it doesn't exist
   - Synchronizes values between `image_path` and `image_url`
   - Creates a trigger to keep these fields in sync for future updates

## Usage Instructions

### Running the Database Fix

1. Log into your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the content from `supabase_image_fields_fix.sql`
4. Run the script

### Best Practices Going Forward

To avoid similar issues in the future:

1. Use consistent field naming in your database schema
2. When accessing fields that might have naming inconsistencies, always check alternative field names
3. Consider implementing similar database triggers for fields that should stay synchronized

## Testing

After implementing these fixes:

1. Go to the Kepenk Sistemleri page on the website
2. Verify that all gallery images are loading correctly
3. Test adding new gallery items through the admin panel
4. Verify that new items appear properly in the gallery
